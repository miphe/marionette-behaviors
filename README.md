# Marionette Behaviors

_Requires Marionette > v3_

A set of abstracted UI functionality in the form of Backbone Marionette behaviors.

This repository will give you only Marionette behaviors, no dependencies at all. You'll be expected to have your Marionette project already set up with it's dependencies before using this package.

## How to use

Install this package via NPM.
`npm install marionette-behaviors --save`

## Examples

There are usage examples of all behaviors in the example directory. This directory is a Backbone/Marionette application that you can run in the following way.

- `npm install`
- `grunt dev-s`
- localhost:9001/

All functionality in the examples directory is out of scope of the behaviors, and is the responsibility of the application to handle. This is simply an application that showcases a simple way of using these behaviors.
